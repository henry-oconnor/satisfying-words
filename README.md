Satisfying Words

Program to find and rank words that are satisfying to type. Satisfying is defined as follows: every finger used must follow its outside neighbor, or follow a finger on the other hand. For example, "powerpoint" goes LEFT pinky-ring RIGHT ring-middle-index LEFT pinky-ring-middle-index RIGHT index. This would give it a score of 6/10, which is very good. 

This program finds all the satisfying words in a list and ranks them by satisfaction score. It could also be used to test alternate keyboard layouts and find the one which gives you the most satisfying words.
